# CheckMateServiceV2
This is for deployment to heroku
This service was split out from the CheckMateV2 Full Stack (MERN Stack) application. The reason for this is because for some reason when I deployed the 
full stack app on Heroku, the NodeJS service was not being recognized. So seperated it out and referenced it in the main app.
